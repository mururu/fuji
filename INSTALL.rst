#. After Armadillo-IoT started up, check IPaddress settings on the Armadillio-IoT by using ifconfig command.
#. Send a executable binary and a config file from your PC via ftp. Please use IPaddress of you just confirmed. The binary and the config file will be sent to `/home/ftp/pub`.
#. Execute fuji-gw from serial console.

   $ go get github.com/shiguredo/fuji/cmd/fuji


Config example
==============

A MQTT broker is required to check the Fuji is runnning. At this example, we will use `Sango<https://sango.shiguredo.jp >`_ which is an `MQTT as a Servce` produced by Shiguredo.

Before setting up Fuji, please access the Sango page and Sign up using your own GitHub account.


Config file
------------------

In this config file, we use dummy device function of Fuji. A dummy device can send some static data to MQTT Broker same as an Sensor.
Since all user can use only topic under `<username>/#` on the Sango, set `topic_prefix` value as is.

.. code-block:: ini

    [gateway]
    
        name = fuji
    
    [broker "sango"]
    
        host = <sango hostname>
        port = 1883
    
        username = <sango username>
        password = <sango password>
    
        retry_interval = 10
        topic_prefix = <sango username>/
    
    
    [device "test/dummy"]
    
        broker = sango
        qos = 0
    
        interval = 10
        payload = Hello MQTT.
    
        type = Dummy

Then, execute fuji-gw with the config file.

::

    $ ./fuji-gw -c <config file path>


Config example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example is set like below.

- host: sango.example.com
- username: shiguredo
- password: pass


.. code-block:: ini

    [gateway]
    
        name = fuji
    
    [broker "sango"]
    
        host = sango.example.com
        port = 1883
    
        username = shiguredo
        password = pass
    
        retry_interval = 10
        topic_prefix = shiguredo@github/
    
    
    [device "test/dummy"]
    
        broker = sango
        qos = 0
    
        interval = 10
        payload = Hello MQTT.
    
        type = Dummy
    


Operation check using mqttcli
------------------------------------------------

`mqttcli` is an tool which can Publish or Subscribe from command line easily.
You can download from `this page<https://drone.io/github.com/shirou/mqttcli/files>`_ . There are some binary which includes Windows, Mac OS, Intel Edison and so on.

After download mqttcli, create setting file for mqttcli.

settings.json::

    {
      "host": "<sango hostname>",
      "port": 1883,
      "username": "<sango username>",
      "password": "<sango password>"
    }


command::

    $ mqttcli sub --conf settings.json  -t "<sango username>/<fuji gateway name>/Dummy"


example::

    $ mqttcli sub --conf settings.json  -t "shiguredo@github/fuji/Dummy"

If you confirm "Hello MQTT." message is sent every 10 sec, that's it.
